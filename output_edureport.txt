This was true for all racial/ethnic groups except American Indian/Alaska Native and Pacific Islander children. Families provide educational tools and opportunities to children, which are closely associated with their families' socioeconomic characteristics. Research has found that living in poverty, lower parental educational attainment, and living in a single-parent household are associated with poor educational outcomes.
